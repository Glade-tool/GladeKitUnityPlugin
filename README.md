# GladeKitUnityPlugin
Agentic AI for Unity Game Development

## Overview

GladeKit is an AI assistant that lives in Unity and builds your game with you. Describe what you want in plain English; the AI writes C# scripts, creates and edits GameObjects, adds components, and runs changes directly in the Editor.

## Quick Start

1. **Before Starting**: Sign up for an account at [GladeKit](https://www.gladekit.com/) to get an active API Key.

## Why use GladeKit?

The problem with existing AI tools is that they don't integrate directly with Unity, which means you constantly have to describe your scene, project context, and much more. Moreover, most existing tools are not able to take action directly in Unity - they can't help you edit your actual scene or anything in the Editor itself.

GladeKit instead:
- Understands your project – Uses your scene hierarchy, scripts, selection, and settings so suggestions fit your setup.
- Acts in the Editor – Creates and edits scripts, GameObjects, components, prefabs, materials, UI, physics, and more, without leaving Unity.
- Lets you choose – Pick your model (GPT-5, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, or Claude 4.5 / Claude 3), adjust how much context is sent, and switch between Create, Debug, and Brainstorm modes.

You can just ask the agent to:
- “Add a player with WASD movement and a third person camera perspective”
- “Enable collision for my player character prefab”
- “Create a main menu with a Play button and settings”
- “Make an enemy that patrols between two points”
- “Find objects with a Renderer but no material and assign a default”
